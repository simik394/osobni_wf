THe work i expect you to do is writen in TODO.md file so use it and keep it updated with you progess. if anything from the todo file is unclear or anyway confusing. add a  markdown callout right after the task item in the todo file.

your ultimate task is to have all the tasks from TODO.md checked as completed. and of course really completed them. you can not check any of the task off until you have runned tests of required feature.
