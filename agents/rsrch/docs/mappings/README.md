# RSRCH Code Mappings

This directory contains code mapping artifacts for the `rsrch` agent, generated by `librarian`.

## Artifacts

### 1. [classes.mermaid](./classes.mermaid)
A generic class diagram showing classes identified in the codebase.
**Usage**: Open in Obsidian (if Mermaid supported) or paste content into [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live).

### 2. [graph.dot](./graph.dot)
A directed graph of all code nodes and relationships (functions, files, calls).
**Usage**:
- Render with Graphviz: `dot -Tpng graph.dot -o graph.png`
- View with xdot: `xdot graph.dot`
- Analyze with srctx or other tools accepting DOT format.

### 3. [index.scip](./index.scip)
The SCIP (Semantic Code Intelligence Protocol) index containing high-fidelity semantic assignments (definitions, references).
**Usage**:
- Can be re-ingested into Librarian: `librarian ingest-scip index.scip`
- Can be used with Sourcegraph tools or other SCIP consumers.

## Generation
These files were generated using:
```bash
librarian scan ../../
librarian export mermaid ../../ > classes.mermaid
librarian export dot ../../ > graph.dot
scip-typescript index
mv ../../index.scip .
```
