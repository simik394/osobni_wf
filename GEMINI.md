# Agent Protocols

- **Lessons Learned**: ALWAYS search for and consult [LESSONS_LEARNED.md](file:///home/sim/Obsi/Prods/01-pwf/LESSONS_LEARNED.md) at the start of a task. After completing a significant feature or solving a complex bug, update this file with new insights. Categorize entries under Technical, Process, or Agentic headers.

## User Mandates
- When making changes, always ensure content is backed up first or added to the destination before removing it from the source to prevent data loss.
- **Docker > Local Installation**: Prefer running tools via Docker containers over installing packages locally (pip, npm, etc.). This keeps the system clean and dependencies isolated.
- **Scripts over Ad-hoc Fixes**: For repeatable tasks (like file renaming, postprocessing), always create a reusable script rather than doing one-time manual fixes. This ensures the solution is persistent and can be integrated into automation pipelines.

## Context Window Monitoring

**Rule**: Report context window usage to the user proactively:

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Every 2-5 responses | Report: "📊 Context: ~XK tokens remaining (Y% used)" |
| After heavy tool usage (5+ calls) | Report immediately before next response |
| Context drops below 50K tokens | Warn: "⚠️ Context getting full, consider new session" |
| Context drops below 25K tokens | Alert: "🔴 Context critical - recommend new session soon" |

**Format**: Brief inline status at start of response, e.g.:
> 📊 Context: ~78K tokens (~49% used)

> [!CAUTION]
> **NO SHORTCUTS - PRODUCTION-GRADE ONLY**
> 
> NEVER take shortcuts like ad-hoc shell scripts, nohup commands, or tmp files when production-grade tools exist.
> 
> **ALWAYS use:**
> - Windmill for job orchestration (NOT nohup/screen/tmux)
> - Proper deployment pipelines (NOT docker cp)
> - Configured APIs with auth (NOT curl hacks)
> - Documented tools and workflows (NOT one-off scripts)
> 
> If a tool isn't configured yet, SET IT UP PROPERLY first. Don't bypass with shortcuts.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Non-Blocking Audio Generation Architecture

> [!CAUTION]
> **THIS ARCHITECTURE IS MANDATORY. DO NOT DEVIATE WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER REQUEST.**
> 
> NotebookLM supports parallel audio generation. NEVER wait for one generation to complete before starting another.

### Required Architecture:
1. **Click Script** (Windmill) → Start generation → **Update FalkorDB** → Set up watcher → **RETURN IMMEDIATELY**
2. **Watcher** → Monitor page in background → Call webhook on completion
3. **Webhook** → **Update FalkorDB** → Send ntfy notification
4. **Queue** → Next click job runs in parallel

### MANDATORY: State Sync with FalkorDB     
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **EVERY browser operation MUST update FalkorDB state.**
> 
> - Click to start generation → Create pending AudioOverview in FalkorDB
> - Audio completes → Update AudioOverview with final title, sourceCount
> - Source selection → Record which source was selected
> - Any state change in browser → Reflect in FalkorDB

### Forbidden Patterns:
- ❌ `await waitForGeneration()` - NEVER block waiting for audio to complete
- ❌ `while (isGenerating) { sleep() }` - NEVER poll in a blocking loop
- ❌ Assuming only one generation can run at a time
- ❌ **Browser actions without corresponding FalkorDB updates**

### Required Behaviors:
- ✅ Trigger generation and return immediately
- ✅ Use existing browser tab if already on correct notebook
- ✅ Queue multiple generations - they run in parallel on cloud
- ✅ Notifications via webhook/watcher, not by blocking
- ✅ **Every browser action updates FalkorDB state**
