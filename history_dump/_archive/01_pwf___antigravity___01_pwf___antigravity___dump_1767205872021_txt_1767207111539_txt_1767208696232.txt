🤔 [THOUGHT]
Thought for 5s
The user is showing me an image of the Antigravity UI showing tool calls. They're saying the file only contains thoughts without interruption, but the UI clearly shows tool calls between thoughts. Let me check the file they have open and investigate why tool calls aren't being captured properly.
Looking at the image, I can see:

🛠️ [TOOL CALL] Retrieved Browser Pages
🛠️ [TOOL CALL] Opened URL in Browser
🛠️ [TOOL CALL] Extracted DOM elements
🛠️ [TOOL CALL] Find iframes
🛠️ [TOOL CALL] Find Tool Elements
🛠️ [TOOL CALL] Find Specific Tool Elements
🛠️ [TOOL CALL] Find Tool Blocks

So in the actual UI, there ARE tool calls. But in the extracted file, they're missing or not being captured correctly. Let me check the file and also clean up old failed scrapes.

I see the issue! The UI clearly shows tool calls between thoughts, but the extraction isn't capturing them in the correct order. Let me check the file and investigate:

I see the problem! The file does have tool calls, but they're all grouped after the thoughts instead of being interleaved in the correct order. This is because the extraction does 4 separate passes:

Extract ALL thoughts
Extract ALL tool calls
Extract ALL prose
Extract ALL user messages

So they're not in chronological order. Let me fix this and clean up old files:

Now let me fix the extraction to maintain chronological order. The issue is we extract by type, not by DOM position:

Fixed syntax errors in session.ts. Rewrote extraction to use single DOM traversal with order tracking. Now testing.

Rewriting getStructuredHistory to maintain DOM order

I need to rewrite this to iterate through elements in DOM order instead of by type. Let me create a new version:

There's a syntax error from the edit - leftover code. Let me view and fix:

Missing the closing brace for the interface. Let me fix:
