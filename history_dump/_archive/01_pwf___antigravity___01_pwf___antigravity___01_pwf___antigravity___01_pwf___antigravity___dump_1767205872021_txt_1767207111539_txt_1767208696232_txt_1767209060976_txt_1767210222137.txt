Progress Update
The scraper is now extracting 61 items (up from 9!), but not the full ~89 turns because of virtualization behavior.
Debug findings:

Scroll jumps from 481px → 25231px (entire scroll range) in one step
The virtualized UI appears to "snap" between message groups rather than smooth scrolling
This causes the scraper to skip intermediate content

Got so far:

25+ thoughts with full thinking content ✅
24+ tool calls ✅
12+ agent prose blocks ✅
File size: ~34KB (up from 3KB) ✅

The extraction is significantly better than before but still not 100% complete due to the UI's virtualization snap behavior.
Would you like me to:

Keep trying to refine the scroll approach (may take more iterations)
Accept this as good enough (captures the bulk of the session)
Try a different approach like scrolling by fixed offsets or using keyboard navigation

Thought for 7s
The user wants me to:

Move old files to a separate directory
Fix the scraping to get a complete session
Show a good scraped session

Let me first move the old files, then try a different scrolling approach. The issue is the virtualized UI snaps between items rather than smooth scrolling. I should try scrolling smaller increments or using a different method to trigger content loading.

Current extraction gets 61/89 items. Debug showed scroll jumping from 481px to 25231px in one step. Need to fix scroll behavior and provide complete extraction.

Moving old files and implementing better scroll approach

Old files archived. Now let me fix the scroll issue. The problem is the virtualized list jumps when scrolling. I need to scroll in much smaller increments and wait longer for content to hydrate:

Still jumping from 200px to 26147px! The issue is deeper - the virtualized UI completely re-renders and snaps to a new position when scrolling.
Let me try a completely different approach: scroll by calling scrollIntoView on elements or use keyboard navigation (Page Down):

The Page Down isn't working in the iframe. Let me try a hybrid approach: manually scroll the container but with forced reflow:

Let me try using scrollTo with behavior smooth and dispatch scroll events:

Still jumping from 400px to 26147px! This is the virtualized UI snapping behavior. Let me try a completely different technique - use wheel events which might trigger different behavior:

The issue may be that the virtualized list is using React-style virtualization that re-renders based on scroll position. Let me try using requestAnimationFrame with multiple smaller scroll steps within one evaluation:
